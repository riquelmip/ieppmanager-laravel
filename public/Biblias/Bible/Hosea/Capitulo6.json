"1. Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he has torn, and he will heal us; he has smitten, and he will bind us up.",
"2. After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.",
"3. Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.",
"4. O Ephraim, what shall I do unto you? O Judah, what shall I do unto you? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goes away.",
"5. Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and your judgments are as the light that goes forth.",
"6. For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.",
"7. But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.",
"8. Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood.",
"9. And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.",
"10. I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.",
"11. Also, O Judah, he has set an harvest for you, when I returned the captivity of my people."
