"1. Hear all of you this, O priests; and hearken, all of you house of Israel; and give all of you ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you, because all of you have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.",
"2. And the apostates are profound to make slaughter, though I have been a rebuker of them all.",
"3. I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, you commit whoredom, and Israel is defiled.",
"4. They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD.",
"5. And the pride of Israel does testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity: Judah also shall fall with them.",
"6. They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find him; he has withdrawn himself from them.",
"7. They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.",
"8. Blow all of you the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at Bethaven, after you, O Benjamin.",
"9. Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.",
"10. The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.",
"11. Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.",
"12. Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.",
"13. When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.",
"14. For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue him.",
"15. I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early."
