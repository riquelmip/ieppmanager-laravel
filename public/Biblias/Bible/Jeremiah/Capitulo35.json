"1. The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,",
"2. Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.",
"3. Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;",
"4. And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:",
"5. And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink all of you wine.",
"6. But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, All of you shall drink no wine, neither all of you, nor your sons for ever:",
"7. Neither shall all of you build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any: but all your days all of you shall dwell in tents; that all of you may live many days in the land where all of you be strangers.",
"8. Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he has charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;",
"9. Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:",
"10. But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.",
"11. But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.",
"12. Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,",
"13. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will all of you not receive instruction to hearken to my words? says the LORD.",
"14. The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father's commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but all of you hearkened not unto me.",
"15. I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return all of you now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and all of you shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but all of you have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.",
"16. Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people has not hearkened unto me:",
"17. Therefore thus says the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.",
"18. And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because all of you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he has commanded you:",
"19. Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not lack a man to stand before me for ever."
