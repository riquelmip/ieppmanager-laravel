"7. Who is this that comes up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the rivers?",

"9. Come up, all of you horses; and rage, all of you chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.",
"10. For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts has a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.",
"11. Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shall you use many medicines; for you shall not be cured.",

"14. Declare all of you in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say all of you, Stand fast, and prepare you; for the sword shall devour round about you.",
"15. Why are your valiant men swept away? they stood not, because the LORD did drive them.",
"16. He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.",
"17. They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he has passed the time appointed.",
"18. As I live, says the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he comes.",
"19. O you daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish yourself to go into captivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant.",
"20. Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction comes; it comes out of the north.",
"21. Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away together: they did not stand, because the day of their calamity was come upon them, and the time of their visitation.",
"22. The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.",
"23. They shall cut down her forest, says the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable.",

"26. And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, says the LORD.",
"27. But fear not you, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel: for, behold, I will save you from far off, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.",
"28. Fear you not, O Jacob my servant, says the LORD: for I am with you; for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have driven you: but I will not make a full end of you, but correct you in measure; yet will I not leave you wholly unpunished."
