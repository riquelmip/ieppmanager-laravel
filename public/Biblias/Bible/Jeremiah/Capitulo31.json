"12. Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.",

"14. And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, says the LORD.",
"15. Thus says the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.",

"17. And there is hope in yours end, says the LORD, that your children shall come again to their own border.",
"18. I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; You have chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock is not accustomed to the yoke: turn you me, and I shall be turned; for you are the LORD my God.",

"27. Behold, the days come, says the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.",
"28. And it shall come to pass, that like I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, says the LORD.",
"29. In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.",
"30. But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eats the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.",
"31. Behold, the days come, says the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:",
"32. Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, says the LORD:",

"37. Thus says the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, says the LORD.",
"38. Behold, the days come, says the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner.",
"39. And the measuring line shall yet go forth opposite to it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.",
"40. And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever."
