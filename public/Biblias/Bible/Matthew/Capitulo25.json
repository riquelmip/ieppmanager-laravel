"1. Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.",
"2. And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.",
"3. They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:",
"4. But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.",
"5. While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.);",
"6. And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom comes; go all of you out to meet him.",
"7. Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.",
"8. And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.",
"9. But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go all of you rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.",
"10. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.",
"11. Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.",
"12. But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.",
"13. Watch therefore, for all of you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man comes.",
"14. For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.",
"15. And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and immediately took his journey.",
"16. Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.",
"17. And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.",
"18. But he that had received one went and dug in the earth, and hid his lord's money.",
"19. After a long time the lord of those servants comes, and reckons with them.",
"20. And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, you delivered unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.",
"21. His lord said unto him, Well done, you good and faithful servant: you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter you into the joy of your lord.",
"22. He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, you delivered unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.",
"23. His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter you into the joy of your lord.",
"24. Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew you that you are an hard man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not scattered:",
"25. And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the earth: lo, there you have that is yours.",
"26. His lord answered and said unto him, You wicked and slothful servant, you knew that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not scattered:",
"27. You ought therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with interest.",
"28. Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which has ten talents.",
"29. For unto every one that has shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that has not shall be taken away even that which he has.",
"30. And cast all of you the useless servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.",
"31. When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:",
"32. And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats:",
"33. And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.",
"34. Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, all of you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:",
"35. For I was an hungered, and all of you gave me food: I was thirsty, and all of you gave me drink: I was a stranger, and all of you took me in:",
"36. Naked, and all of you clothed me: I was sick, and all of you visited me: I was in prison, and all of you came unto me.",
"37. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we you an hungered, and fed you? or thirsty, and gave you drink?",
"38. When saw we you a stranger, and took you in? or naked, and clothed you?",
"39. Or when saw we you sick, or in prison, and came unto you?",
"40. And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as all of you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, all of you have done it unto me.",
"41. Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, all of you cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:",
"42. For I was an hungered, and all of you gave me no food: I was thirsty, and all of you gave me no drink:",
"43. I was a stranger, and all of you took me not in: naked, and all of you clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and all of you visited me not.",
"44. Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we you an hungered, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto you?",
"45. Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as all of you did it not to one of the least of these, all of you did it not to me.",
"46. And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal."
