Moreover, when all of you shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, all of you shall offer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy portion of the land: the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand. This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about.",

"16. All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel.",
"17. And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and food offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the food offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.",

"20. And so you shall do the seventh day of the month for every one that errs, and for him that is simple: so shall all of you reconcile the house.",
"21. In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, all of you shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.",
"22. And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering.",
