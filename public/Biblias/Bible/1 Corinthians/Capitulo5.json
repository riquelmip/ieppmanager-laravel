"1. It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.",
"2. And all of you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be taken away from among you.",
"3. For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,",
"4. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when all of you are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,",
"5. To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.",
"6. Your glorying is not good. Know all of you not that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?",
"7. Purge out therefore the old leaven, that all of you may be a new lump, as all of you are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:",
"8. Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.",
"9. I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:",
"10. Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortionists, or with idolaters; for then must all of you essentially go out of the world.",
"11. But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortionist; with such an one no not to eat.",
"12. For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not all of you judge them that are within?",
"13. But them that are without God judges. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person."
