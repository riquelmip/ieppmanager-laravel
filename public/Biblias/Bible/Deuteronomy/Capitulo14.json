"1. All of you are the children of the LORD your God: all of you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.",
"2. For you are an holy people unto the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be an exclusive people unto himself, above all the nations that are upon the earth.",
"3. You shall not eat any abominable thing.",
"4. These are the beasts which all of you shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,",
"5. The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.",
"6. And every beast that parts the hoof, and cleaves the cleft into two claws, and chews the cud among the beasts, that all of you shall eat.",
"7. Nevertheless these all of you shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore they are unclean unto you.",
"8. And the swine, because it divides the hoof, yet chews not the cud, it is unclean unto you: all of you shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcass.",
"9. These all of you shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall all of you eat:",
"10. And whatsoever has not fins and scales all of you may not eat; it is unclean unto you.",
"11. Of all clean birds all of you shall eat.",
"12. But these are they of which all of you shall not eat: the eagle, and the vulture, and the buzzard,",
"13. And the vulture, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,",
"14. And every raven after his kind,",
"15. And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckoo, and the hawk after his kind,",
"16. The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,",
"17. And the pelican, and the carrion vulture, and the cormorant,",
"18. And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.",
"19. And every creeping thing that flies is unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten.",
"20. But of all clean fowls all of you may eat.",
"21. All of you shall not eat of anything that dies of itself: you shall give it unto the stranger that is in your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it unto an foreigner: for you are an holy people unto the LORD your God. You shall not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.",
"22. You shall truly tithe all the increase of your seed, that the field brings forth year by year.",
"23. And you shall eat before the LORD your God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of your corn, of your wine, and of yours oil, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks; that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always.",
"24. And if the way be too long for you, so that you are not able to carry it; or if the place be too far from you, which the LORD your God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD your God has blessed you:",
"25. Then shall you turn it into money, and bind up the money in yours hand, and shall go unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose:",
"26. And you shall bestow that money for whatsoever your soul lusts after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever your soul desires: and you shall eat there before the LORD your God, and you shall rejoice, you, and yours household,",
"27. And the Levite that is within your gates; you shall not forsake him; for he has no part nor inheritance with you.",
"28. At the end of three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of yours increase the same year, and shall lay it up within your gates:",
"29. And the Levite, (because he has no part nor inheritance with you,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within your gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of yours hand which you do."
