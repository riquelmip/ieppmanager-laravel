"20. But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.",
"21. If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.",
"22. Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.",
"23. But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.",
"24. And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, able to teach, patient,",
"25. In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God possibly will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;",
"26. And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will."
