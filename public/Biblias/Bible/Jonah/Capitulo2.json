"1. Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly,",
"2. And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and you heard my voice.",
"3. For you had cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all your billows and your waves passed over me.",
"4. Then I said, I am cast out of your sight; yet I will look again toward your holy temple.",
"5. The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.",
"6. I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet have you brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.",
"7. When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto you, into yours holy temple.",
"8. They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.",
"9. But I will sacrifice unto you with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.",
"10. And the LORD spoke unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land."
