"1. Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;",
"2. It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did reverence.",
"3. And David said unto him, From whence come you? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.",
"4. And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray you, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.",
"5. And David said unto the young man that told him, How know you that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?",
"6. And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.",
"7. And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.",
"8. And he said unto me, Who are you? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.",
"9. He said unto me again, Stand, I pray you, upon me, and slay me: for anguish has come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.",
"10. So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here unto my lord.",
"11. Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:",
"12. And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.",
"13. And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence are you? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.",
"14. And David said unto him, How were you not afraid to stretch forth yours hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?",
"15. And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he stroke him that he died.",
"16. And David said unto him, Your blood be upon your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.",
"17. And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:",
"18. (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)",
"19. The beauty of Israel is slain upon your high places: how are the mighty fallen!",
"20. Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.",
"21. All of you mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.",
"22. From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.",
"23. Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.",
"24. All of you daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.",
"25. How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, you were slain in yours high places.",
"26. I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant have you been unto me: your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.",
"27. How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!"
