"1. Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?",
"2. Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.",
"3. They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.",
"4. They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.",
"5. Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising early for a prey: the wilderness yields food for them and for their children.",
"6. They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.",
"7. They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.",
"8. They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for lack of a shelter.",
"9. They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.",
"10. They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;",
"11. Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.",
"12. Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded cries out: yet God lays not folly to them.",
"13. They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.",
"14. The murderer rising with the light kills the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.",
"15. The eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguises his face.",
"16. In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.",
"17. For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.",
"18. He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholds not the way of the vineyards.",
"19. Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so does the grave those which have sinned.",
"20. The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.",
"21. He evil entreats the barren that bears not: and does not good to the widow.",
"22. He draws also the mighty with his power: he rises up, and no man is sure of life.",
"23. Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he rests; yet his eyes are upon their ways.",
"24. They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.",
"25. And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?"
