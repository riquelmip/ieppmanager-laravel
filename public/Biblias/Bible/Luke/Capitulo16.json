"1. And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.",
"2. And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of you? give an account of your stewardship; for you may be no longer steward.",
"3. Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord takes away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.",
"4. I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.",
"5. So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owe you unto my lord?",
"6. And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take your bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.",
"7. Then said he to another, And how much owe you? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take your bill, and write fourscore.",
"8. And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.",
"9. And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when all of you fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.",
"10. He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.",
"11. If therefore all of you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?",
"12. And if all of you have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?",
"13. No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. All of you cannot serve God and mammon.",
"14. And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.",
"15. And he said unto them, All of you are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knows your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.",
"16. The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presses into it.",
"17. And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.",
"18. Whosoever puts away his wife, and marries another, commits adultery: and whosoever marries her that is put away from her husband commits adultery.",
"19. There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:",
"20. And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,",
"21. And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.",
"22. And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;",
"23. And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and sees Abraham far off, and Lazarus in his bosom.",
"24. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.",
"25. But Abraham said, Son, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and you are tormented.",
"26. And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from behind to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.",
"27. Then he said, I pray you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father's house:",
"28. For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.",
"29. Abraham says unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.",
"30. And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.",
"31. And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead."
