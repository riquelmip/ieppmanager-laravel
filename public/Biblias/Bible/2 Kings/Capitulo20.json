"1. In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus says the LORD, Set yours house in order; for you shall die, and not live.",
"2. Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying,",
"3. I plead to you, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.",
"4. And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,",
"5. Return, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears: behold, I will heal you: on the third day you shall go up unto the house of the LORD.",
"6. And I will add unto your days fifteen years; and I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.",
"7. And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.",
"8. And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?",
"9. And Isaiah said, This sign shall you have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?",
"10. And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.",
"11. And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.",
"12. At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.",
"13. And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.",
"14. Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto you? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.",
"15. And he said, What have they seen in yours house? And Hezekiah answered, All the things that are in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.",
"16. And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.",
"17. Behold, the days come, that all that is in yours house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, says the LORD.",
"18. And of your sons that shall issue from you, which you shall brought forth, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.",
"19. Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which you have spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days?",
"20. And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?",
"21. And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his position."
