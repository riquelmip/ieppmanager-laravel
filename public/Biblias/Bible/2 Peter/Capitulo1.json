"1. Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:",
"2. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,",
"3. According as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:",
"4. Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these all of you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.",
"5. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;",
"6. And to knowledge wilful restrain; and to wilful restrain patience; and to patience godliness;",
"7. And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness love.",
"8. For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that all of you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
"9. But he that lacks these things is blind, and cannot see far off, and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.",
"10. Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if all of you do these things, all of you shall never fall:",
"11. For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.",
"12. Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though all of you know them, and be established in the present truth.",
"13. Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;",
"14. Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ has showed me.",
"15. Moreover I will endeavour that all of you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.",
"16. For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.",
"17. For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.",
"18. And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.",
"19. We have also a more sure word of prophecy; unto which all of you do well that all of you take heed, as unto a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:",
"20. Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.",
"21. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit."
