"1. Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for you shall no more be called tender and delicate.",
"2. Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover your locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.",
"3. Your nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, your shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet you as a man.",
"4. As for our redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.",
"5. Sit you silent, and get you into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for you shall no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.",
"6. I was angry with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into yours hand: you did show them no mercy; upon the ancient have you very heavily laid your yoke.",
"7. And you said, I shall be a lady for ever: so that you did not lay these things to your heart, neither did remember the latter end of it.",
"8. Therefore hear now this, you that are given to pleasures, that dwell carelessly, that says in yours heart, I am, and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:",
"9. But these two things shall come to you in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon you in their perfection for the multitude of your sorceries, and for the great abundance of yours enchantments.",
"10. For you have trusted in your wickedness: you have said, None sees me. Your wisdom and your knowledge, it has perverted you; and you have said in yours heart, I am, and none else beside me.",
"11. Therefore shall evil come upon you; you shall not know from whence it rises: and mischief shall fall upon you; you shall not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon you suddenly, which you shall not know.",
"12. Stand now with yours enchantments, and with the multitude of your sorceries, wherein you have laboured from your youth; if so be you shall be able to profit, if so be you may prevail.",
"13. You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly sign tellers, stand up, and save you from these things that shall come upon you.",
"14. Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.",
"15. Thus shall they be unto you with whom you have laboured, even your merchants, from your youth: they shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save you."
