"1. Woe to you that spoil, and you were not spoiled; and deal treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with you! when you shall cease to spoil, you shall be spoiled; and when you shall make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with you.",
"2. O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for you: be you their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.",
"3. At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of yourself the nations were scattered.",
"4. And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpillar: as the running back and forth of locusts shall he run upon them.",
"5. The LORD is exalted; for he dwells on high: he has filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.",
"6. And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of your times, and strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his treasure.",
"7. Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.",
"8. The highways lie waste, the travelling man ceases: he has broken the covenant, he has despised the cities, he regards no man.",
"9. The earth mourns and languishes: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits.",
"10. Now will I rise, says the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.",
"11. All of you shall conceive chaff, all of you shall bring forth stubble: your breath, as fire, shall devour you.",
"12. And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.",
"13. Hear, all of you that are far off, what I have done; and, all of you that are near, acknowledge my might.",
"14. The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness has surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?",
"15. He that walks righteously, and speaks uprightly; he that despises the gain of oppressions, that shakes his hands from holding of bribes, that stops his ears from hearing of blood, and shuts his eyes from seeing evil;",
"16. He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.",
"17. Yours eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.",
"18. Yours heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where is the receiver? where is he that counted the towers?",
"19. You shall not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than you can perceive; of a stammering tongue, that you can not understand.",
"20. Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: yours eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.",
"21. But there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.",
"22. For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; he will save us.",
"23. Your tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.",
"24. And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity."
