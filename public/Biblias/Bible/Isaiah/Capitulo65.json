"1. I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.",
"2. I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walks in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;",
"3. A people that provokes me to anger continually to my face; that sacrifices in gardens, and burns incense upon altars of brick;",
"4. Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;",
"5. Which say, Stand by yourself, come not near to me; for I am holier than you. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all the day.",
"6. Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,",
"7. Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, says the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.",
"8. Thus says the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.",
"9. And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.",
"10. And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.",
"11. But all of you are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.",
"12. Therefore will I number you to the sword, and all of you shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, all of you did not answer; when I spoke, all of you did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.",
"13. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but all of you shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but all of you shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but all of you shall be ashamed:",
"14. Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but all of you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit.",
"15. And all of you shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay you, and call his servants by another name:",
"16. That he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.",
"17. For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.",
"18. But be all of you glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.",
"19. And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.",
"20. There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that has not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.",
"21. And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.",
"22. They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.",
"23. They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.",
"24. And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.",
"25. The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, says the LORD."
