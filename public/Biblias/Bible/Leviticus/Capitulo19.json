"7. And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it shall not be accepted.",

"15. All of you shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: you shall not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbour.",
"16. You shall not go up and down as a talebearer among your people: neither shall you stand against the blood of your neighbour; I am the LORD.",
"17. You shall not hate your brother in yours heart: you shall in any way rebuke your neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.",
"18. You shall not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbour as yourself: I am the LORD.",
"19. All of you shall keep my statutes. You shall not let your cattle gender with a diverse kind: you shall not sow your field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woolen come upon you.",
"20. And whosoever lies carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.",
"21. And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass offering.",
"22. And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he has done: and the sin which he has done shall be forgiven him.",
"23. And when all of you shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then all of you shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.",
"24. But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD likewise.",
"25. And in the fifth year shall all of you eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.",

"28. All of you shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.",

"31. Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.",
"32. You shall rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear your God: I am the LORD.",
"33. And if a stranger sojourn with you in your land, all of you shall not vex him.",
"34. But the stranger that dwells with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and you shall love him as yourself; for all of you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.",
"35. All of you shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measuring rod, in weight, or in measure.",
"36. Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall all of you have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.",
"37. Therefore shall all of you observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the LORD."
