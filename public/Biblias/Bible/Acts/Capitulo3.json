"1. Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.",
"2. And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;",
"3. Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.",
"4. And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.",
"5. And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.",
"6. Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.",
"7. And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.",
"8. And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.",
"9. And all the people saw him walking and praising God:",
"10. And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.",
"11. And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.",
"12. And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, All of you men of Israel, why marvel all of you at this? or why look all of you so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?",
"13. The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus; whom all of you delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.",
"14. But all of you denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;",
"15. And killed the Prince of life, whom God has raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.",
"16. And his name through faith in his name has made this man strong, whom all of you see and know: yea, the faith which is by him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.",
"17. And now, brethren, I know that through ignorance all of you did it, as did also your rulers.",
"18. But those things, which God before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he has so fulfilled.",
"19. Repent all of you therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.",
"20. And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:",
"21. Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.",
"22. For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall all of you hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.",
"23. And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.",
"24. Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.",
"25. All of you are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.",
"26. Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities."
