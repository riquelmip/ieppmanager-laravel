	"versiculos": [
"1. How beautiful are your feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of your thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.",
"2. Your navel is like a round goblet, which wants not liquor: your belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.",
"3. Your two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.",
"4. Your neck is as a tower of ivory; yours eyes like the pool in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: your nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.",
"5. Yours head upon you is like Carmel, and the hair of yours head like purple; the king is held in the galleries.",
"6. How fair and how pleasant are you, O love, for delights!",
"7. This your stature is like to a palm tree, and your breasts to clusters of grapes.",
"8. I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also your breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of your nose like apples;",
"9. And the roof of your mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goes down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.",
"10. I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.",
"11. Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.",
"12. Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give you my loves.",
"13. The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved."
