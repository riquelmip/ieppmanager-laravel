"1. Where is your beloved gone, O you fairest among women? where is your beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with you.",
"2. My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.",
"3. I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feeds among the lilies.",
"4. You are beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.",
"5. Turn away yours eyes from me, for they have overcome me: your hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.",
"6. Your teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one bears twins, and there is not one barren among them.",
"7. As a piece of a pomegranate are your temples within your locks.",
"8. There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.",
"9. My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.",
"10. Who is she that looks forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?",
"11. I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded.",
"12. Before even I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.",
"13. Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon you. What will all of you see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies."
