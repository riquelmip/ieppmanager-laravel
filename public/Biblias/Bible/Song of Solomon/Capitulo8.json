"1. O that you were as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find you without, I would kiss you; yea, I should not be despised.",
"2. I would lead you, and bring you into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause you to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.",
"3. His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.",
"4. I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that all of you stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please.",
"5. Who is this that comes up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised you up under the apple tree: there your mother brought you forth: there she brought you forth that bare you.",
"6. Set me as a seal upon yours heart, as a seal upon yours arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which has a most vehement flame.",
"7. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.",
"8. We have a little sister, and she has no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?",
"9. If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.",
"10. I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.",
"11. Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.",
"12. My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: you, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.",
"13. You that dwell in the gardens, the companions hearken to your voice: cause me to hear it.",
"14. Make haste, my beloved, and be you like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices."
