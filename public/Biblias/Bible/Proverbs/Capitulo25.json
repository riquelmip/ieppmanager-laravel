"1. These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.",
"2. It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.",
"3. The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.",
"4. Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.",
"5. Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.",
"6. Put not forth yourself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men:",
"7. For better it is that it be said unto you, Come up here; than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince whom yours eyes have seen.",
"8. Go not forth hastily to strive, lest you know not what to do in the end thereof, when your neighbour has put you to shame.",
"9. Debate your cause with your neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another:",
"10. Lest he that hears it put you to shame, and yours ill repute turn not away.",
"11. A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.",
"12. As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.",
"13. As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refreshes the soul of his masters.",
"14. Whoso boasts himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.",
"15. By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaks the bone.",
"16. Have you found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for you, lest you be filled therewith, and vomit it.",
"17. Withdraw your foot from your neighbour's house; lest he be weary of you, and so hate you.",
"18. A man that bears false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.",
"19. Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.",
"20. As he that takes away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon alkali, so is he that sings songs to an heavy heart.",
"21. If yours enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:",
"22. For you shall heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward you.",
"23. The north wind drives away rain: so does an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.",
"24. It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.",
"25. As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.",
"26. A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.",
"27. It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory.",
"28. He that has no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls."
