"3. Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful food.",
"4. Labour not to be rich: cease from yours own wisdom.",
"5. Will you set yours eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.",
"6. Eat you not the bread of him that has an evil eye, neither desire you his dainty meats:",
"7. For as he thinks in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, says he to you; but his heart is not with you.",
"8. The morsel which you have eaten shall you vomit up, and lose your sweet words.",
"9. Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of your words.",

"25. Your father and your mother shall be glad, and she that bare you shall rejoice.",

"27. For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit.",
"28. She also lies in wait as for a prey, and increases the transgressors among men.",
"29. Who has woe? who has sorrow? who has contentions? who has babbling? who has wounds without cause? who has redness of eyes?",
"30. They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.",
"31. Look not you upon the wine when it is red, when it gives his colour in the cup, when it moves itself aright.",
"32. At the last it bites like a serpent, and stings like an adder.",
"33. Yours eyes shall behold strange women, and yours heart shall utter perverse things.",
"34. Yea, you shall be as he that lies down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lies upon the top of a mast.",
"35. They have stricken me, shall you say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again."
