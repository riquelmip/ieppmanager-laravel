"1. As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not suitable for a fool.",
"2. As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.",
"3. A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back.",
"4. Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest you also be like unto him.",
"5. Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.",
"6. He that sends a message by the hand of a fool cuts off the feet, and drinks damage.",
"7. The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of fools.",
"8. As he that binds a stone in a sling, so is he that gives honour to a fool.",
"9. As a thorn goes up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouths of fools.",
"10. The great God that formed all things both rewards the fool, and rewards transgressors.",
"11. As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool returns to his folly.",
"12. See you a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him.",
"13. The slothful man says, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets.",
"14. As the door turns upon his hinges, so does the slothful upon his bed.",
"15. The slothful hides his hand in his bosom; it grieves him to bring it again to his mouth.",

"17. He that passes by, and meddles with strife belonging not to him, is like one that takes a dog by the ears.",
"18. As a mad man who casts firebrands, arrows, and death,",
"19. So is the man that deceives his neighbour, and says, Am not I in sport?",
"20. Where no wood is, there the fire goes out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceases.",
"21. As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife.",
"22. The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.",
"23. Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross.",
"24. He that hates dissembles with his lips, and lays up deceit within him;",
"25. When he speaks fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart.",
"26. Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be showed before the whole congregation.",
"27. Whoso digs a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolls a stone, it will return upon him.",
"28. A lying tongue hates those that are afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth works ruin."
