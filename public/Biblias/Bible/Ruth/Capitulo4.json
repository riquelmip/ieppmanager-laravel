"1. Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.",
"2. And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit all of you down here. And they sat down.",
"3. And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that has come again out of the country of Moab, sells a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:",
"4. And I thought to advertise you, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it: but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside you; and I am after you. And he said, I will redeem it.",
"5. Then said Boaz, What day you buy the field of the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.",
"6. And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I ruin mine own inheritance: redeem you my right to yourself; for I cannot redeem it.",
"7. Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, in order to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel.",
"8. Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for you. So he drew off his shoe.",
"9. And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, All of you are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.",
"10. Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: all of you are witnesses this day.",
"11. And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that has come into yours house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do you worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:",
"12. And let your house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give you of this young woman.",
"13. So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.",
"14. And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which has not left you this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.",
"15. And he shall be unto you a restorer of your life, and a nourisher of yours old age: for your daughter in law, which loves you, which is better to you than seven sons, has born him.",
"16. And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.",
"17. And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.",
"18. Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez brings forth Hezron,",
"19. And Hezron brings forth Ram, and Ram brings forth Amminadab,",
"20. And Amminadab brings forth Nahshon, and Nahshon brings forth Salmon,",
"21. And Salmon brings forth Boaz, and Boaz brings forth Obed,",
"22. And Obed brings forth Jesse, and Jesse brings forth David."
