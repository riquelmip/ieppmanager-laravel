"1. Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.",
"2. There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.",
"3. Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.",
"4. Then says one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,",
"5. Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?",
"6. This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.",
"7. Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying has she kept this.",
"8. For the poor always all of you have with you; but me all of you have not always.",
"9. Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.",
"10. But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;",
"11. Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.",
"12. On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,",
"13. Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that comes in the name of the Lord.",
"14. And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,",
"15. Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, your King comes, sitting on an ass's colt.",
"16. These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.",
"17. The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.",
"18. For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.",
"19. The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive all of you how all of you prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.",
"20. And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:",
"21. The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.",
"22. Philip comes and tells Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.",
"23. And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come, that the Son of man should be glorified.",
"24. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abides alone: but if it die, it brings forth much fruit.",
"25. He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.",
"26. If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.",
"27. Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.",
"28. Father, glorify your name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.",
"29. The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spoke to him.",
"30. Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.",
"31. Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.",
"32. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.",
"33. This he said, signifying what death he should die.",
"34. The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abides for ever: and how says you, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?",
"35. Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while all of you have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walks in darkness knows not where he goes.",
"36. While all of you have light, believe in the light, that all of you may be the children of light. These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.",
"37. But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:",
"38. That the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?",
"39. Therefore they could not believe, because that Isaiah said again,",
"40. He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.",
"41. These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.",
"42. Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:",
"43. For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.",
"44. Jesus cried and said, He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that sent me.",
"45. And he that sees me sees him that sent me.",
"46. I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believes on me should not abide in darkness.",
"47. And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.",
"48. He that rejects me, and receives not my words, has one that judges him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.",
"49. For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.",
"50. And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak."
