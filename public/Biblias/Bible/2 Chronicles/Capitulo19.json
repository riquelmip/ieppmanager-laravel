"2. And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Should you help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon you from before the LORD.",
"3. Nevertheless there are good things found in you, in that you have taken away the groves out of the land, and have prepared yours heart to seek God.",
"4. And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers.",
"5. And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city,",
"6. And said to the judges, Take heed what all of you do: for all of you judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment.",
"7. Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.",

"10. And what cause whatsoever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in your cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, all of you shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and all of you shall not trespass.",
