"4. But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.",

"8. And Solomon said unto God, You have showed great mercy unto David my father, and have made me to reign in his position.",
"9. Now, O LORD God, let your promise unto David my father be established: for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.",
"10. Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this your people, that is so great?",
"11. And God said to Solomon, Because this was in yours heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of yours enemies, neither yet have asked long life; but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people, over whom I have made you king:",
"12. Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto you; and I will give you riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before you, neither shall there any after you have the like.",

"16. And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.",
"17. And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means."
