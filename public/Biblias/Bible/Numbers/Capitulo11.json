"4. And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?",
"5. We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:",

"13. Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.",
"14. I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.",

"16. And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with you.",
"17. And I will come down and talk with you there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon you, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you bear it not yourself alone.",
"18. And say you unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, and all of you shall eat flesh: for all of you have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and all of you shall eat.",
"19. All of you shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;",
"20. But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that all of you have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?",
"21. And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and you have said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.",

"26. But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.",
"27. And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.",
"28. And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.",
"29. And Moses said unto him, Envy you for my sake? would God that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them!",
"30. And Moses got him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.",
"31. And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.",
"32. And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.",
