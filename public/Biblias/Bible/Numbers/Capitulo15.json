"20. All of you shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering: as all of you do the heave offering of the threshing floor, so shall all of you heave it.",
"21. Of the first of your dough all of you shall give unto the LORD an heave offering in your generations.",
"22. And if all of you have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the LORD has spoken unto Moses,",
"23. Even all that the LORD has commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations;",
"24. Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with his food offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.",
"25. And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:",
"26. And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourns among them; seeing all the people were in ignorance.",
"27. And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering.",
"28. And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sins ignorantly, when he sins by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.",
"29. All of you shall have one law for him that sins through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourns among them.",
"30. But the soul that does ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproaches the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.",

"34. And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.",
"35. And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.",
"36. And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.",
"37. And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,",
"38. Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a thread of blue:",
"39. And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that all of you may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that all of you seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which all of you use to go a whoring:",
"40. That all of you may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.",
"41. I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God."
