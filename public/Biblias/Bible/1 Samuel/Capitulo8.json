"1. And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.",
"2. Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.",
"3. And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after illegal gain, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.",
"4. Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,",
"5. And said unto him, Behold, you are old, and your sons walk not in your ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.",
"6. But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.",
"7. And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto you: for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.",
"8. According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto you.",
"9. Now therefore hearken unto their voice: nevertheless yet protest solemnly unto them, and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.",
"10. And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.",
"11. And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.",
"12. And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.",
"13. And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.",
"14. And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive yards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.",
"15. And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.",
"16. And he will take your male servants, and your maidservants, and your best young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.",
"17. He will take the tenth of your sheep: and all of you shall be his servants.",
"18. And all of you shall cry out in that day because of your king which all of you shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.",
"19. Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;",
"20. That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.",
"21. And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.",
"22. And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go all of you every man unto his city."
