"1. Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.",
"2. And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.",
"3. And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.",
"4. And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.",
"5. And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.",
"6. And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims.",
"7. For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.",
"8. And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.",
"9. There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.",
"10. And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,",
"11. So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.",
"12. Then spoke Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.",
"13. I have surely built you an house to dwell in, a settled place for you to abide in for ever.",
"14. And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)",
"15. And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spoke with his mouth unto David my father, and has with his hand fulfilled it, saying,",
"16. Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.",
"17. And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.",
"18. And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in yours heart to build an house unto my name, you did well that it was in yours heart.",
"19. Nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son that shall come forth out of your loins, he shall build the house unto my name.",
"20. And the LORD has performed his word that he spoke, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.",
"21. And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.",
"22. And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:",
"23. And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keep covenant and mercy with your servants that walk before you with all their heart:",
"24. Who have kept with your servant David my father that you promised him: you spoke also with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with yours hand, as it is this day.",
"25. Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that you promised him, saying, There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that your children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as you have walked before me.",
"26. And now, O God of Israel, let your word, I pray you, be verified, which you spoke unto your servant David my father.",
"27. But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built?",
"28. Yet have you respect unto the prayer of your servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which your servant prays before you to day:",
"29. That yours eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which you have said, My name shall be there: that you may hearken unto the prayer which your servant shall make toward this place.",
"30. And hearken you to the supplication of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear you in heaven your dwelling place: and when you hear, forgive.",
"31. If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before yours altar in this house:",
"32. Then hear you in heaven, and do, and judge your servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.",
"33. When your people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against you, and shall return to you, and confess your name, and pray, and make supplication unto you in this house:",
"34. Then hear you in heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which you gave unto their fathers.",
"35. When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you afflict them:",
"36. Then hear you in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, that you teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance.",
"37. If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;",
"38. What prayer and supplication whatsoever be made by any man, or by all your people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:",
"39. Then hear you in heaven your dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart you know; (for you, even you only, know the hearts of all the children of men;)",
"40. That they may fear you all the days that they live in the land which you gave unto our fathers.",
"41. Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of your people Israel, but comes out of a far country for your name's sake;",
"42. (For they shall hear of your great name, and of your strong hand, and of your stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;",
"43. Hear you in heaven your dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calls to you for: that all people of the earth may know your name, to fear you, as do your people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have built, is called by your name.",
"44. If your people go out to battle against their enemy, anywhere you shall send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which you have chosen, and toward the house that I have built for your name:",
"45. Then hear you in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.",
"46. If they sin against you, (for there is no man that sins not,) and you be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;",
"47. Yet if they shall call to reflect themselves in the land where they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto you in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;",
"48. And so return unto you with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto you toward their land, which you gave unto their fathers, the city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name:",
"49. Then hear you their prayer and their supplication in heaven your dwelling place, and maintain their cause,",
"50. And forgive your people that have sinned against you, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against you, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:",
"51. For they be your people, and yours inheritance, which you brought forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:",
"52. That yours eyes may be open unto the supplication of your servant, and unto the supplication of your people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto you.",
"53. For you did separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be yours inheritance, as you spoke by the hand of Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, O LORD God.",
"54. And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.",
"55. And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,",
"56. Blessed be the LORD, that has given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there has not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.",
"57. The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:",
"58. That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.",
"59. And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:",
"60. That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.",
"61. Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.",
"62. And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.",
"63. And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.",
"64. The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and food offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brazen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and food offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.",
"65. And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.",
"66. On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people."
