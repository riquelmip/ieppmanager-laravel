"1. The elder unto the beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.",
"2. Beloved, I wish above all things that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.",
"3. For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in you, even as you walk in the truth.",
"4. I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.",
"5. Beloved, you do faithfully whatsoever you do to the brethren, and to strangers;",
"6. Which have borne witness of your love before the church: whom if you bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, you shall do well:",
"7. Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.",
"8. We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellow-helpers to the truth.",
"9. I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, receives us not.",
"10. Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he does, babbling against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither does he himself receive the brethren, and forbids them that would, and casts them out of the church.",
"11. Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that does good is of God: but he that does evil has not seen God.",
"12. Demetrius has good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and all of you know that our record is true.",
"13. I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto you:",
"14. But I trust I shall shortly see you, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to you. Our friends salute you. Greet the friends by name."
