"1. My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?",
"2. O my God, I cry in the day time, but you hear not; and in the night season, and am not silent.",
"3. But you are holy, O you that inhabit the praises of Israel.",
"4. Our fathers trusted in you: they trusted, and you did deliver them.",
"5. They cried unto you, and were delivered: they trusted in you, and were not confounded.",
"6. But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.",
"7. All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,",
"8. He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.",
"9. But you are he that took me out of the womb: you did make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.",
"10. I was cast upon you from the womb: you are my God from my mother's belly.",
"11. Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.",
"12. Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.",
"13. They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.",
"14. I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.",
"15. My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaves to my jaws; and you have brought me into the dust of death.",
"16. For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.",
"17. I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.",
"18. They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.",
"19. But be not you far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste you to help me.",
"20. Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.",
"21. Save me from the lion's mouth: for you have heard me from the horns of the unicorns.",
"22. I will declare your name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise you.",
"23. All of you that fear the LORD, praise him; all you the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all you the seed of Israel.",
"24. For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither has he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.",
"25. My praise shall be of you in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.",
"26. The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.",
"27. All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the families of the nations shall worship before you.",
"28. For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among the nations.",
"29. All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.",
"30. A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.",
"31. They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he has done this."
