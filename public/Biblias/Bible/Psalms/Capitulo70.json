"1. MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O LORD.",
"2. Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.",
"3. Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.",
"4. Let all those that seek you rejoice and be glad in you: and let such as love your salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.",
"5. But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: you are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying."
