"1. Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.",
"2. Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto you will I pray.",
"3. My voice shall you hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto you, and will look up.",
"4. For you are not a God that has pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with you.",
"5. The foolish shall not stand in your sight: you hate all workers of iniquity.",
"6. You shall destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will detest the bloody and deceitful man.",
"7. But as for me, I will come into your house in the multitude of your mercy: and in your fear will I worship toward your holy temple.",
"8. Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness because of mine enemies; make your way straight before my face.",
"9. For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open tomb; they flatter with their tongue.",
"10. Destroy you them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against you.",
"11. But let all those that put their trust in you rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because you defend them: let them also that love your name be joyful in you.",
"12. For you, LORD, will bless the righteous; with favour will you compass him as with a shield."
