"3. Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;",
"4. I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,",
"5. Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.",
"6. Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.",

"10. For your servant David's sake turn not away the face of yours anointed.",
"11. The LORD has sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of your body will I set upon your throne.",
