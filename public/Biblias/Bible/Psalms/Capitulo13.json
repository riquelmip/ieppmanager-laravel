"1. How long will you forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long will you hide your face from me?",
"2. How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?",
"3. Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;",
"4. Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.",
"5. But I have trusted in your mercy; my heart shall rejoice in your salvation.",
"6. I will sing unto the LORD, because he has dealt bountifully with me."
