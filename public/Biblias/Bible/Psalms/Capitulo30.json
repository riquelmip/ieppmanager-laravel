"1. I will extol you, O LORD; for you have lifted me up, and have not made my foes to rejoice over me.",
"2. O LORD my God, I cried unto you, and you have healed me.",
"3. O LORD, you have brought up my soul from the grave: you have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.",
"4. Sing unto the LORD, O all of you saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.",
"5. For his anger endures but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.",
"6. And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.",
"7. LORD, by your favour you have made my mountain to stand strong: you did hide your face, and I was troubled.",
"8. I cried to you, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.",
"9. What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise you? shall it declare your truth?",
"10. Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be you my helper.",
"11. You have turned for me my mourning into dancing: you have put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;",
"12. To the end that my glory may sing praise to you, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto you for ever."
