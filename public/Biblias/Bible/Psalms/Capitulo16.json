"1. Preserve me, O God: for in you do I put my trust.",
"2. O my soul, you have said unto the LORD, You are my Lord: my goodness extends not to you;",
"3. But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.",
"4. Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.",
"5. The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: you maintain my lot.",
"6. The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.",
"7. I will bless the LORD, who has given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.",
"8. I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.",
"9. Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices: my flesh also shall rest in hope.",
"10. For you will not leave my soul in hell; neither will you suffer yours Holy One to see corruption.",
"11. You will show me the path of life: in your presence is fullness of joy; at your right hand there are pleasures for evermore."
