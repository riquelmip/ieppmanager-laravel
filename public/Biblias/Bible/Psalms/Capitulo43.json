"1. Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.",
"2. For you are the God of my strength: why do you cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?",
"3. O send out your light and your truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto your holy hill, and to your tabernacles.",
"4. Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise you, O God my God.",
"5. Why are you cast down, O my soul? and why are you disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God."
