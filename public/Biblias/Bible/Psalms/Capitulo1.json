"1. Blessed is the man that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful.",
"2. But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law does he meditate day and night.",
"3. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he does shall prosper.",
"4. The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.",
"5. Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.",
"6. For the LORD knows the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish."
