"1. I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.",
"2. I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.",
"3. My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spoke I with my tongue,",
"4. LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is: that I may know how frail I am.",
"5. Behold, you have made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before you: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.",
"6. Surely every man walks in a vain show: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heaps up riches, and knows not who shall gather them.",
"7. And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in you.",
"8. Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.",
"9. I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because you did it.",
"10. Remove your stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of yours hand.",
"11. When you with rebukes do correct man for iniquity, you make his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity. Selah.",
"12. Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not your peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with you, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.",
"13. O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go behind, and be no more."
