"1. Lord, who shall abide in your tabernacle? who shall dwell in your holy hill?",
"2. He that walks uprightly, and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart.",
"3. He that backbites not with his tongue, nor does evil to his neighbour, nor takes up a reproach against his neighbour.",
"4. In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honors them that fear the LORD. He that swears to his own hurt, and changes not.",
"5. He that puts not out his money to interest, nor takes reward against the innocent. He that does these things shall never be moved."
