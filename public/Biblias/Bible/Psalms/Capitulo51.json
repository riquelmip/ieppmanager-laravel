"2. Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.",
"3. For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.",

"5. Behold, I was formed in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.",
"6. Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part you shall make me to know wisdom.",
"7. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.",
