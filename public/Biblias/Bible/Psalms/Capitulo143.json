"1. Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in your faithfulness answer me, and in your righteousness.",
"2. And enter not into judgment with your servant: for in your sight shall no man living be justified.",
"3. For the enemy has persecuted my soul; he has smitten my life down to the ground; he has made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.",
"4. Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.",
"5. I remember the days of old; I meditate on all your works; I meditate on the work of your hands.",
"6. I stretch forth my hands unto you: my soul thirsts after you, as a thirsty land. Selah.",
"7. Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit fails: hide not your face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.",
"8. Cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning; for in you do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto you.",
"9. Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto you to hide me.",
"10. Teach me to do your will; for you are my God: your spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.",
"11. Restore life in me, O LORD, for your name's sake: for your righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.",
"12. And of your mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am your servant."
