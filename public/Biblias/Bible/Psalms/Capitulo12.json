"1. Help, LORD; for the godly man ceases; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.",
"2. They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.",
"3. The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaks proud things:",
"4. Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?",
"5. For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, says the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffs at him.",
"6. The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.",
"7. You shall keep them, O LORD, you shall preserve them from this generation for ever.",
"8. The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted."
