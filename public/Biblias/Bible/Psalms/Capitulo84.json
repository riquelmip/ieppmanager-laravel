"1. How lovely are your tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!",
"2. My soul longs, yea, even faints for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh cries out for the living God.",
"3. Yea, the sparrow has found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even yours altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.",
"4. Blessed are they that dwell in your house: they will be still praising you. Selah.",
"5. Blessed is the man whose strength is in you; in whose heart are the ways of them.",
"6. Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also fills the pools.",
"7. They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appears before God.",
"8. O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.",
"9. Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of yours anointed.",
"10. For a day in your courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.",
