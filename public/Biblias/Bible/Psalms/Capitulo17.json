"1. Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that goes not out of feigned lips.",
"2. Let my sentence come forth from your presence; let yours eyes behold the things that are equal.",
"3. You have proved mine heart; you have visited me in the night; you have tried me, and shall find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.",
"4. Concerning the works of men, by the word of your lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.",
"5. Hold up my activities in your paths, that my footsteps slip not.",
"6. I have called upon you, for you will hear me, O God: incline yours ear unto me, and hear my speech.",
"7. Show your marvellous loving kindness, O you that save by your right hand them which put their trust in you from those that rise up against them.",
"8. Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of your wings,",
"9. From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about.",
"10. They are enclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.",
"11. They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;",
"12. Like a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.",
"13. Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is your sword:",
"14. From men which are your hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly you fill with your hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.",
"15. As for me, I will behold your face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with your likeness."
