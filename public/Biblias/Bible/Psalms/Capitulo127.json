"1. Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman wakes but in vain.",
"2. It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he gives his beloved sleep.",
"3. Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.",
"4. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.",
"5. Happy is the man that has his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate."
