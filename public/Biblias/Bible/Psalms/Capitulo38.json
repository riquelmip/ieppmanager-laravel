"1. O lord, rebuke me not in your wrath: neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.",
"2. For yours arrows stick fast in me, and your hand presses me sore.",
"3. There is no soundness in my flesh because of yours anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.",
"4. For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.",
"5. My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.",
"6. I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.",
"7. For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.",
"8. I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the chaos of my heart.",
"9. Lord, all my desire is before you; and my groaning is not hid from you.",
"10. My heart pants, my strength fails me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.",
"11. My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand far off.",
"12. They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.",
"13. But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that opens not his mouth.",
"14. Thus I was as a man that hears not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.",
"15. For in you, O LORD, do I hope: you will hear, O Lord my God.",
"16. For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slips, they magnify themselves against me.",
"17. For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.",
"18. For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.",
"19. But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.",
"20. They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.",
"21. Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.",
"22. Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation."
