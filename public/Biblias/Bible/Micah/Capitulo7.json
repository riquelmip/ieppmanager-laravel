"1. Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the gleaning of grapes of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my soul desired the first-fruits fruit.",
"2. The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.",
"3. That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asks, and the judge asks for a reward; and the great man, he utters his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.",
"4. The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge: the day of your watchmen and your visitation comes; now shall be their perplexity.",
"5. Trust all of you not in a friend, put all of you not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of your mouth from her that lies in your bosom.",
"6. For the son dishonours the father, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.",
"7. Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.",
"8. Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto me.",
"9. I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.",
"10. Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD your God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.",
"11. In the day that your walls are to be built, in that day shall the decree be far removed.",
"12. In that day also he shall come even to you from Assyria, and from the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.",
"13. Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.",
"14. Feed your people with your rod, the flock of yours heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.",
"15. According to the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt will I show unto him marvellous things.",
"16. The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf.",
"17. They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of you.",
"18. Who is a God like unto you, that pardons iniquity, and passes by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retains not his anger for ever, because he delights in mercy.",
"19. He will return, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and you will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.",
"20. You will perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which you have sworn unto our fathers from the days of old."
